Holster By Hold - Hold R hotkey to holster your weapon
------------------------------------------------------

Please keep in mind that the game official patches will probably revert 
these changes so you must apply everything again with each new patch dropped.


1. FIRST THINGS FIRST - PLEASE BACKUP THE GAME CONFIG FOLDER!
  
 - Go to Cyberpunk 2077\r6 and backup "config" folder.

2. Add holding definitions for reload hotkey to inputContexts.xml:

 - Open Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config\inputContexts.xml
   with Notepad++ or any other text editor
	

 - Find this line:

	<!-- HOLD ACTIONS -->


   and add line to actions list below:

	<hold action="Reload"						timeout="0.4" />


   to make this file section look like this as a result:

	<!-- HOLD ACTIONS -->
	<hold action="Reload"						timeout="0.4" />
	<hold action="Jump"							timeout="0.15" />
	
   - 0.4 is time to hold the hotkey which triggers holding event, 
     you can change it if you want (must be above zero)


 - Find this line:
 
	<!-- EVENTS -->
	

   and add this block below:
	
	<acceptedEvents action="Reload" >
		<event name="BUTTON_RELEASED" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_PROGRESS" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_COMPLETE" />
	</acceptedEvents>
	

   to make this file section look like this as a result:

	<!-- EVENTS -->
	<acceptedEvents action="Reload" >
		<event name="BUTTON_RELEASED" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_PROGRESS" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_COMPLETE" />
	</acceptedEvents>
	<acceptedEvents action="upgrade_perk" >
		<event name="BUTTON_PRESSED" />
		<event name="BUTTON_RELEASED" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_PROGRESS" />
		<event name="BUTTON_HOLD_COMPLETE" />
	</acceptedEvents>

3. Enjoy the game!
