Improved Minimap Zoom - Peek Hotkey step-by-step guide
------------------------------------------------------

Please keep in mind that the game official patches will probably revert 
these changes so you must apply everything again with each new patch dropped.

If you defined hotkeys for the previous version before then you can
just replace minimap related code blocks with the new ones.


1. FIRST THINGS FIRST - PLEASE BACKUP THE GAME CONFIG FOLDER!
  
 - Go to Cyberpunk 2077\r6 and backup "config" folder.

2. Add new hotkey definition to inputContexts.xml:

 - Open Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config\inputContexts.xml
   with Notepad++ or any other text editor
	

 - Find this line:

    <context name="UIShared">


   and add line to actions list below:

        <action name="minimapPeek"                                     map="minimapPeek_Button"                         priority="-1" />


   to make this file section look like this as a result:

    <context name="UIShared">
        <include name="UI" />
        <include name="UINotifications" />
        <action name="minimapPeek"                                     map="minimapPeek_Button"                         priority="-1" />
        <action name="back"                                            map="back"                                        priority="-1" />


3. Add new hotkey definitions to inputUserMappings.xml:

 - Open Cyberpunk 2077\r6\config\inputUserMappings.xml
   with Notepad++ or any other text editor
    
 - Find mappings block start at the begining of the file:
 
    <!-- MAPPINGS -->

   and add this block below:

    <mapping name="minimapPeek_Button" type="Button" >
        <button id="IK_F6" />
    </mapping>

   to make this file section look like this as a result:

    <!-- MAPPINGS -->
    <mapping name="minimapPeek_Button" type="Button" >
        <button id="IK_F6" />
    </mapping>

 - Do not worry if you already have other hotkeys added there, 
   you can add just add any new definitions under <!-- MAPPINGS --> line at 
   the beginning of the file.
   
 - You may replace "IK_F6" with any other hotkey from this file if you want.

4. Enjoy the game!
